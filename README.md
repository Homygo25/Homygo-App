# Homygo App

This repository contains the source for the Homygo web application.

## PHP setup

To install PHP and required dependencies locally, run:

```bash
./scripts/install-php.sh
```

After installation, verify PHP is available:

```bash
php -v
```

This installs `php`, `php-cli`, `php-fpm`, `php-curl`, `php-mbstring`, and `php-xml` using `apt-get`.
